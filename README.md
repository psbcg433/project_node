# Node Projects Repository

This repository contains **mini-projects** built with **Node.js, MERN stack, and Next.js**. Each project follows a structured naming convention:

- `XX_node_projectname` â†’ Node.js-based projects
- `XX_mern_projectname` â†’ MERN stack projects
- `XX_next_projectname` â†’ Next.js projects

### Features:
- Each project is standalone and follows best coding practices.
- A `.gitignore` file ensures `node_modules` and `.env` files are not committed.
- A `README.md` is included in each project with setup and usage instructions.
